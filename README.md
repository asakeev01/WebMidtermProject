# WebMidtermProject
Mid-term project for the web.
My project is a real order from a logistics company with a wide spectrum of services. I decided to show it as a mid-term project because it is the best sample of work in the web technologies area. In my project, I used a lot of tools such as Bootstrap, css, jQuery and js.
